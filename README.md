Sherlock is a simple database that stores profiles about people. It uses localStorage, which means the information gets stored locally in your browser (not in your cookies). It's kind of useless in terms of real life application because you can't share your localStorage with other people, but that's not the reason I made this. I made it because I felt like it was a good practice exercise. Side note: there's an issue on Mac OS where <select> doesn't take all of the CSS that I give it. It works on Windows and Linux and Chrome OS but on Mac OS, it only takes the font and color while it ignores everything about borders and padding. I am working on fixing it.
