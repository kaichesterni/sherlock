# Sherlock

Sherlock is a simple database that stores profiles for people. It uses localStorage, which means the information gets stored locally in your browser, not in your cookies, which means that there is no 5 MB data storage limit. In terms of real life application, Sherlock cannot yet be synced across devices; therefore, it can only be used as a contact book. However, this may become possible in an upcoming update.
